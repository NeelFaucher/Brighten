To make the most of our application be sure to accept bluetooth, location, steps, and sleep tracking within the app. This is to ensure you are able to pair with our light therapy lamp, as well as track your physical activity, and your sleep quality through the daily generated scores. However, the choice is yours so please enable what you are comfortable with. At any point you will be able to log-out from the app by pressing the 'logout' button on the bottom of the dashboard page.
